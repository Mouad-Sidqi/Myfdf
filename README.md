# Myfdf
This is my fdf(Wireframe) project at 1337 school. The executable takes as inpu, a file containing numbers that represent
the z-axis values in a 3D space. if you're thinking of checking out the project, i advise you to use 0.6 ver as it is much
simpler to read and contains minilibx library aswell.
